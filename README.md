## Description

This project implements a graphical electronic movie library using C++ and the Simple Graphics Library (SGG). It provides an interface for browsing and filtering films based on attributes such as title, release year, director, cast, and genre, with the flexibility to include additional details like plot descriptions. The application is structured around an object-oriented hierarchy of GUI components derived from an abstract Widget class, using inheritance and polymorphism to support buttons, sliders, text fields, and other interactive elements. STL containers are employed for efficient data management, while the interface enables searching, exploring, and displaying movie information inspired by modern streaming platforms. The implementation focuses on clean architecture, reusable code, and proper documentation, adhering to the requirement of using SGG exclusively for all graphical functionality.
